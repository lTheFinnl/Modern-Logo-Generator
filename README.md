# Modern-Logo-Generator
I've always been confused by the abstract names companies have been giving themselves lately, so I've decided to mimic this behavior with a simple Python script.

If you'd like to try it out yourself, it's easy. Just download the .zip file and run the script. I also included a "/fonts/" folder which you can upload your desired .ttf files. Four are included by default. https://fonts.google.com/ is a good place to find some more fonts if you are interested.

You can use, modify, and distribute this in any way you like if you feel so inclined...
