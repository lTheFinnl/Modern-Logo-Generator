# Modern-Logo-Generator
I've always been confused by the abstract names companies have been giving themselves lately, so I've decided to mimic this behavior with a simple Python script. I'm going off of the oversimplified logo trend where companies are beginning to make their logos into their name on a monochrome background.

If you'd like to try it out yourself, it's easy. Just download the .zip file and run the script. I also included a "/fonts/" folder to which you can upload your desired .ttf files. Four are included by default. I've found bold fonts to look the most convincing, but you can try whatever you like.

https://fonts.google.com/ is a good place to find some more fonts if you are interested.

You can use, modify, and distribute this in any way you like if you feel so inclined...

Here are some examples of the program's generated logos:

The script could potentially produce inapproproate results, and I have not put any safeguards into place concerning this. If you are worried about seeing a certain word with four letters and nonconsecutive vowels, though chances are small, I cannot guarantee that your worst nightmare won't become a reality!
